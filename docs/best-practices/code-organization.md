# Code Organization Best Practices

## Directory Structure

The SIP Assistant project should follow a consistent and logical directory structure:

```
SIP-assistant/
├── src/                  # All source code
│   ├── components/       # Vue components (modular, focused)
│   ├── providers/        # LLM provider implementations
│   │   ├── base.js       # Base provider definition
│   │   ├── factory.js    # Factory pattern
│   │   ├── agents/       # Agent-specific provider implementations
│   ├── services/         # Business logic services
│   ├── utils/            # Shared utilities
│   ├── config/           # Configuration management
│   ├── App.vue           # Root Vue component
│   ├── main.js           # Frontend entry point
│   └── chatbot.js        # Backend server entry point
├── tests/                # All test files
│   ├── unit/             # Unit tests
│   ├── integration/      # Integration tests
│   └── e2e/              # End-to-end tests
├── docs/                 # Documentation
│   ├── best-practices/   # Best practices guides
│   └── refactoring/      # Refactoring plans and notes
├── public/               # Static assets
├── dist/                 # Build output
└── data/                 # Data storage
```

## File Size and Complexity

1. **Maximum File Size**: 
   - Vue components should not exceed 300 lines
   - JavaScript modules should not exceed 400 lines
   - If a file grows beyond these limits, it should be refactored into smaller, more focused modules

2. **Component Structure**:
   - Break large components into smaller, reusable components
   - Use composition to build complex UIs from simple building blocks
   - Follow the single responsibility principle

3. **Service Organization**:
   - Each service should have a clear, focused purpose
   - Large services should be split into domain-specific modules
   - Use dependency injection to manage service relationships

## Naming Conventions

1. **Files and Directories**:
   - Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `chat-service.js`)
   - Use PascalCase for Vue component files (e.g., `ChatInterface.vue`)
   - Use descriptive, purpose-indicating names

2. **Variables and Functions**:
   - Use camelCase for variables and functions
   - Use PascalCase for classes and constructors
   - Use descriptive names that indicate purpose

3. **Constants**:
   - Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
   - Group related constants in dedicated files

## Code Quality

1. **Testing**:
   - Write tests for all new features
   - Maintain test coverage above 80%
   - Use appropriate test types (unit, integration, e2e)

2. **Documentation**:
   - Document all public APIs and interfaces
   - Include JSDoc comments for functions
   - Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Use consistent error handling patterns
   - Log errors with appropriate context
   - Provide meaningful error messages to users

## Refactoring Guidelines

1. **When to Refactor**:
   - When adding new features to complex areas
   - When fixing bugs in hard-to-understand code
   - When code metrics indicate high complexity
   - Before implementing similar functionality elsewhere

2. **Refactoring Approach**:
   - Make small, incremental changes
   - Maintain test coverage during refactoring
   - Document significant architectural changes

3. **Code Smells to Watch For**:
   - Duplicated code
   - Long methods or functions
   - Large classes or components
   - Deep nesting
   - Excessive comments explaining complex logic

## Dependency Management

1. **External Dependencies**:
   - Minimize external dependencies
   - Regularly update dependencies for security
   - Document why each dependency is needed

2. **Internal Dependencies**:
   - Use clear import/export patterns
   - Avoid circular dependencies
   - Use dependency injection for testability

## Performance Considerations

1. **Frontend**:
   - Lazy load components when possible
   - Optimize rendering performance
   - Minimize DOM manipulations

2. **Backend**:
   - Use appropriate caching strategies
   - Optimize database queries
   - Handle asynchronous operations efficiently

By following these best practices, we can maintain a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase for the SIP Assistant project.
