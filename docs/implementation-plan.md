   - Expand a document to view its content
   - Confirm the information is accurate and properly cited

2. **Workflow Integration Test:**
   - Start a conversation about a governance topic
   - Search for related precedents
   - Reference a result in your conversation
   - Verify the AI acknowledges and incorporates the reference

3. **Performance Test:**
   - Perform an initial search and note the response time
   - Perform the same search again and confirm it's faster
   - Try variations of the same search to test semantic understanding

4. **Error Recovery Test:**

# Implementation Guidelines

## Branching Strategy

1. **Feature Branches:**
   - Create a new branch for each sprint from main
   - Use naming convention: `feature/feature-name` or `refactor/feature-name`
   - Keep branches focused on a single sprint's work

2. **Task Branches (Optional for Complex Tasks):**
   - For complex tasks, create sub-branches from the sprint branch
   - Use naming convention: `feature/feature-name/task-description`
   - Merge back to the sprint branch when complete

3. **Merge Strategy:**
   - Complete all tasks in a sprint before merging to main
   - Perform code review before merging
   - Resolve any conflicts with main before merging
   - Use merge commits (not squash) to preserve history

## Commit Guidelines

1. **When to Commit:**
   - Commit after completing each logical task
   - Commit when you've made progress worth saving
   - Commit at the specifically marked commit points
   - Always commit before ending a work session

2. **Commit Message Format:**
   ```
   [Sprint#][Task#] Brief description of changes

   - Detailed bullet point of change 1
   - Detailed bullet point of change 2
   ```

3. **Commit Content:**
   - Keep commits focused on related changes
   - Don't mix refactoring and new features in the same commit
   - Include updated tests with implementation changes

## Testing Guidelines

1. **Test Before Committing:**
   - Always run existing tests before committing
   - Add new tests for new functionality
   - Verify all testing criteria are met

2. **Types of Testing:**
   - Unit tests for individual functions/components
   - Integration tests for interactions between components
   - End-to-end tests for complete workflows
   - Manual testing for UI and user experience

3. **Test Coverage:**
   - Focus on critical paths and business logic
   - Include edge cases and error scenarios
   - Document test scenarios not covered by automated tests

## Documentation Guidelines

1. **Code Documentation:**
   - Add JSDoc comments for functions and classes
   - Include purpose, parameters, and return values
   - Document complex algorithms and business rules

2. **Commit Documentation:**
   - Reference task numbers in commit messages
   - Explain why changes were made, not just what
   - Document any known limitations or issues

3. **UI Documentation:**
   - Add tooltips and help text for complex features
   - Create user guides for new functionality
   - Document keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features

# Where to Start

Begin with Sprint 1 (Frontend Refactoring) to break down the large UI components. This will create a more maintainable codebase and set the foundation for adding new features. The specific starting points are:

1. Create the `refactor/frontend-components` branch from main
2. Begin with Task 1: Audit ChatInterface.vue
3. Follow the sprint tasks in sequence
4. Complete the entire sprint before moving to Sprint 2

This approach will ensure you have a solid foundation before adding new features. The frontend refactoring is a natural starting point as it will make the codebase more manageable and prepare it for the new UI panels needed for agent capabilities.

# Development Checkpoints

## Major Checkpoints (Milestone Reviews)

1. **After Sprint 2:**
   - Frontend and backend refactoring is complete
   - Code is more modular and maintainable
   - No functionality has been lost
   - Foundation is in place for new features

2. **After Sprint 4:**
   - Retrieval Agent is fully implemented
   - Vector search is working
   - First new capability is available to users
   - System architecture is proven with one agent

3. **After Sprint 7:**
   - All agents are implemented
   - Complete workflow is functional
   - System can generate full proposals
   - Basic integration testing is complete

4. **After Sprint 8:**
   - System is fully polished and tested
   - Documentation is complete
   - Performance is optimized
   - Project is ready for production use

## Interim Checkpoints

- **End of Each Task:**
  - Verify all testing criteria are met
  - Commit with detailed message
  - Document any issues or learnings

- **End of Each Sprint:**
  - Complete code review
  - Run full test suite
  - Merge sprint branch to main
  - Update project documentation

These checkpoints will help ensure consistent progress and quality throughout the project.
