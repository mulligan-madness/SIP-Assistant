# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for SIP-Assistant

## 1. Introduction

Governance proposal drafting for DAOs is currently a labor-intensive, manually driven process. As a Governance Facilitator & Foundation Manager for SuperRare and RareDAO, you engage in a complex, iterative process—researching historical forum posts, extracting context, drafting proposals based on strict DAO standards, and simulating community critique to refine your output. This process is difficult to scale, error-prone, and relies heavily on your unique expertise.

**Vision:**  
The SIP-Assistant aims to revolutionize this process by automating and standardizing governance proposal drafting. By leveraging a network of specialized AI agents and a robust retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, the tool will not only streamline your workflow but also cultivate individual and collective wisdom. In the long run, this system will serve as a "precedent library" (like those in big law firms) and a platform that scales expertise across diverse domains—not just DAO governance.

## 3. System Overview & Architecture

### Core Components

- **Frontend (Vue.js):**  
  - **Current Role:** Provides the chat interface and basic UI for interacting with the system.
  - **Future Role:** A modular interface that supports multiple panels (chat, research, drafting, and feedback) with simple component communication through Vue's built-in reactivity system.
    - The research panel will start as a simple, minimalist display of retrieval results with basic citation information and document expansion capabilities. This MVP approach will allow for quick validation of the core retrieval functionality before adding more complex features.

- **Backend (Node.js):**  
  - **Current Role:** Hosts a basic chatbot and forum scraper.
  - **Future Role:** Extends the existing provider framework to support new agent capabilities while maintaining the clean abstraction layer already in place.

- **AI Capabilities:**  
  - **Current Role:** Basic chat functionality with multiple provider options (OpenAI, Anthropic, Local).
  - **Future Role:** Enhanced capabilities leveraging the existing provider architecture to add specialized agent functionality:
    - **Retrieval Agent**
    - **Research Agent**
    - **Interviewing Agent**
    - **Drafting Agent** (integrating iterative critique)

- **Integration Layer:**  
  - Lightweight integration between components using direct API calls and the existing provider framework.
  - Simple, focused approach prioritizing quick delivery of functionality.

## 5. Implementation Approach

**Philosophy:**  
Build for speed and learning, not premature scaling. The implementation will prioritize delivering core value quickly, embracing selective technical debt where it makes sense, and using the simplest viable solutions.

**Key Principles:**
- Implement one valuable feature at a time
- Leverage existing code wherever possible
- Avoid speculative architecture
- Prioritize features that deliver direct user value
- Test with real users early and often

**Integration Strategy:**
- Use direct API calls between components
- Leverage existing provider abstractions rather than creating new ones
- Keep the system monolithic initially for simplicity and speed
- Avoid implementing complex state management until necessary

---

## 6. Implementation Strategy: Enhance & Extend

### Enhance What Works:

1. **Frontend (Vue.js):**
   - Improve the existing `ChatInterface.vue` component by extracting reusable parts
   - Use Vue's basic reactivity system for state management (avoid adding Vuex/Pinia complexity)
   - Add new UI panels as simple components while maintaining the overall app structure
   - Leverage existing styling and UX patterns for consistency

2. **Backend (Node.js):**
   - Extend the existing provider framework (maintain the `LLMProviderFactory` pattern)
   - Refactor `chatbot.js` into logical modules without changing the overall architecture
   - Improve error handling and logging throughout
   - Maintain the existing API structure while adding new endpoints

3. **General Improvements:**
   - Focus testing on critical user paths rather than comprehensive coverage
   - Apply ESLint/Prettier to ensure code consistency
   - Document key interfaces and architectural decisions

### Build New Capabilities:

1. **Vector Search Implementation:**
   - Implement vector search directly in Node.js initially (possibly using third-party services)
   - Add a VectorProvider that follows the same patterns as existing providers

2. **Agent Capabilities:**
   - Build agent capabilities sequentially, starting with the Retrieval Agent
   - Implement each agent as a provider extension that follows existing patterns
   - Add specialized prompts and processing logic for each agent type
   - Integrate agents directly into the existing backend before separating them

3. **Deployment Approach:**
   - Start with a simple deployment model (single-service)
   - Use environment variables for configuration
   - Add monitoring for critical paths
   - Consider serverless options for simplicity initially
