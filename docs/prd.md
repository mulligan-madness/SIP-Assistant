# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for SIP-Assistant

## 1. Introduction

Governance proposal drafting for DAOs is currently a labor-intensive, manually driven process. As a Governance Facilitator & Foundation Manager for SuperRare and RareDAO, you engage in a complex, iterative process—researching historical forum posts, extracting context, drafting proposals based on strict DAO standards, and simulating community critique to refine your output. This process is difficult to scale, error-prone, and relies heavily on your unique expertise.

**Vision:**  
The SIP-Assistant aims to revolutionize this process by automating and standardizing governance proposal drafting. By leveraging a network of specialized AI agents and a robust retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, the tool will not only streamline your workflow but also cultivate individual and collective wisdom. In the long run, this system will serve as a “precedent library” (like those in big law firms) and a platform that scales expertise across diverse domains—not just DAO governance.

**Functionality:**
- **API Coordination:**  
  - Define and enforce API contracts (using JSON-based communication) between the backend and each AI microservice.
- **Asynchronous Processing:**  
  - Manage long-running tasks via asynchronous calls, ensuring that slow responses from any one agent do not block overall progress.
