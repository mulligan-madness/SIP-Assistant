# SIP Assistant Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for refactoring the SIP Assistant codebase to improve its architecture, maintainability, and adherence to established best practices. It serves as a living document to track progress across multiple development sessions.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: PROGRESS TRACKING INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

**THESE INSTRUCTIONS MUST BE FOLLOWED BY ALL CONTRIBUTORS INCLUDING FUTURE CHAT SESSIONS:**

1. When a task is completed:
   - Change `[ ]` to `[x]` for the completed task
   - Add completion information in this exact format: `- [x] Task description - Completed by @username on YYYY-MM-DD`
   - Add any relevant notes indented below the task

2. When working on a task:
   - Mark it as in progress: `- [-] Task description - In progress by @username since YYYY-MM-DD` 

3. When updating this document:
   - Also update the "Last updated" date at the bottom of this file
   - Keep all formatting consistent with these guidelines
   - Never remove the progress tracking instructions

4. Example format:
   ```markdown
   - [x] Completed task - Completed by @username on YYYY-MM-DD
       - Note: Additional implementation details here
   - [-] Task in progress - In progress by @username since YYYY-MM-DD
   - [ ] Pending task
   ```

**EVERY CHAT SESSION MUST COMPLY WITH THESE TRACKING INSTRUCTIONS**

## Approach

We will follow a **code-first approach** to refactoring:

1. First, implement structural code changes
2. Then update tests to match the new structure
3. Use updated tests to validate refactored code

This approach is more efficient than fixing tests before refactoring code, as it prevents duplicated work and ensures tests target the final codebase structure.

## Current Status

- [x] **Phase 1: Test Infrastructure Consolidation** - Completed on 2024-03-06
  - [x] Remove empty test directory - Completed by @AI-Assistant on 2024-03-06
  - [x] Update package.json for Vitest - Completed by @AI-Assistant on 2024-03-06
  - [x] Configure vitest.config.js - Completed by @AI-Assistant on 2024-03-06
  - [x] Update documentation - Completed by @AI-Assistant on 2024-03-06

## Refactoring Tasks

### Phase 2: Directory Structure Reorganization

**Reference**: See [Code Organization Best Practices](../best-practices/code-organization.md)

- [ ] Consolidate utility functions
  - [ ] Move duplicate utility functions to a central location
  - [ ] Standardize error handling helpers
  - [ ] Update imports across the codebase

- [ ] Reorganize provider directory
  - [ ] Ensure consistent interfaces for all providers
  - [ ] Implement proper inheritance hierarchy
  - [ ] Add missing provider documentation

- [ ] Reorganize services
  - [ ] Clear separation of concerns between services
  - [ ] Move business logic from chatbot.js to appropriate services
  - [ ] Standardize error handling

### Phase 3: Component Refactoring

**Reference**: See [Component Design Best Practices](../best-practices/component-design.md)

- [ ] Break down large components
  - [ ] Identify components exceeding 300 lines
  - [ ] Extract reusable sub-components
  - [ ] Implement proper props validation

- [ ] Improve component communication
  - [ ] Replace direct parent-child communication with proper events
  - [ ] Use composition for complex UI elements
  - [ ] Standardize event naming

### Phase 4: Backend Architecture Improvements

**Reference**: See [Backend Architecture Best Practices](../best-practices/backend-architecture.md)

- [ ] Implement service-oriented architecture
  - [ ] Define clear service interfaces
  - [ ] Implement dependency injection
  - [ ] Remove circular dependencies

- [ ] Standardize API design
  - [ ] Ensure RESTful endpoint consistency
  - [ ] Implement proper validation middleware
  - [ ] Standardize error responses

- [ ] Improve error handling
  - [ ] Implement global error handler
  - [ ] Add structured logging
  - [ ] Add request tracking

### Phase 5: LLM Integration Enhancements

**Reference**: See [LLM Integration Best Practices](../best-practices/llm-integration.md)

- [ ] Enhance provider architecture
  - [ ] Complete factory pattern implementation
  - [ ] Add proper fallback mechanisms
  - [ ] Implement caching for repeated requests

- [ ] Improve prompt engineering
  - [ ] Create standardized prompt templates
  - [ ] Implement few-shot examples
  - [ ] Add output validation

- [ ] Add security enhancements
  - [ ] Implement input sanitization
  - [ ] Add prompt injection prevention
  - [ ] Add cost management features

### Phase 6: Test Updates and Expansion

**Reference**: See [Testing Best Practices](../best-practices/testing.md)

- [ ] Fix import paths in existing tests
  - [ ] Update all test imports to match new structure
  - [ ] Fix failing tests

- [ ] Expand test coverage
  - [ ] Add missing unit tests
  - [ ] Add integration tests for critical paths
  - [ ] Ensure 80%+ code coverage

- [ ] Improve test organization
  - [ ] Ensure tests mirror source code structure
  - [ ] Standardize test naming conventions
  - [ ] Add proper test documentation

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing these refactoring tasks:

1. **Make incremental changes**: Small, focused PRs are easier to review
2. **Maintain backward compatibility**: Ensure existing functionality continues to work
3. **Follow best practices**: Reference the docs/best-practices guides
4. **Document decisions**: Add comments for non-obvious implementation choices
5. **Update documentation**: Keep docs in sync with code changes

## Next Steps

The immediate focus should be on Phase 2: Directory Structure Reorganization, followed by the other phases in order. Within each phase, tasks can be prioritized based on impact and dependencies.
