# SIP Assistant Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for refactoring the SIP Assistant codebase to improve its architecture, maintainability, and adherence to established best practices. It serves as a living document to track progress across multiple development sessions.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: PROGRESS TRACKING INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

**THESE INSTRUCTIONS MUST BE FOLLOWED BY ALL CONTRIBUTORS INCLUDING FUTURE CHAT SESSIONS:**

1. When a task is completed:
   - Change `[ ]` to `[x]` for the completed task
   - Add completion information in this exact format: `- [x] Task description - Completed by @username on YYYY-MM-DD`
   - Add any relevant notes indented below the task

2. When working on a task:
   - Mark it as in progress: `- [-] Task description - In progress by @username since YYYY-MM-DD` 

3. When updating this document:
   - Also update the "Last updated" date at the bottom of this file
   - Keep all formatting consistent with these guidelines
   - Never remove the progress tracking instructions

4. Example format:
   ```markdown
   - [x] Completed task - Completed by @username on YYYY-MM-DD
       - Note: Additional implementation details here
   - [-] Task in progress - In progress by @username since YYYY-MM-DD
   - [ ] Pending task
   ```

**EVERY CHAT SESSION MUST COMPLY WITH THESE TRACKING INSTRUCTIONS**

## Approach

We will follow a **code-first approach** to refactoring:

1. First, implement structural code changes
2. Then update tests to match the new structure
3. Use updated tests to validate refactored code

This approach is more efficient than fixing tests before refactoring code, as it prevents duplicated work and ensures tests target the final codebase structure.

## Current Status

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing these refactoring tasks:

1. **Make incremental changes**: Small, focused PRs are easier to review
2. **Maintain backward compatibility**: Ensure existing functionality continues to work
3. **Follow best practices**: Reference the docs/best-practices guides
4. **Document decisions**: Add comments for non-obvious implementation choices
5. **Update documentation**: Keep docs in sync with code changes

## Next Steps

With Phase 2: Directory Structure Reorganization now complete, the focus should shift to Phase 3: Component Refactoring. This will involve breaking down large components, improving component communication, and implementing proper props validation.
