# Test Directory Consolidation

This document outlines the changes made to consolidate the test directories in the SIP Assistant project.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed Empty Test Directory**
   - Removed the empty `test` directory that was no longer being used

2. **Updated Package.json**
   - Updated test scripts to use Vitest instead of Jest
   - Removed Jest-related dependencies

3. **Updated Vitest Configuration**
   - Added proper path aliases in `vitest.config.js` to support the new test directory structure
   - Configured test patterns to include all test files in the `tests` directory

4. **Updated Documentation**
   - Updated the README.md to reflect the new project structure
   - Updated testing documentation to replace Jest references with Vitest
   - Created a migration guide from Jest to Vitest

## New Test Directory Structure

```
tests/
├── unit/           # Unit tests
├── integration/    # Integration tests
├── providers/      # Provider-specific tests
├── utils/          # Test utilities
└── helpers/        # Test helpers
```

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Structure**: All tests are now in a single `tests` directory with logical subdirectories
2. **Improved Organization**: Tests are organized by type and component
3. **Better Discoverability**: Easier to find and run specific tests
4. **Consistent Naming**: All test files follow the same naming convention
5. **Modern Testing Framework**: Migrated from Jest to Vitest for better performance and Vue integration

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Import Paths**: Update import paths in test files to use the new directory structure
2. **Fix Test Failures**: Address the test failures that were identified during the migration
3. **Add More Tests**: Add more tests to improve coverage
4. **Update CI Configuration**: Update CI configuration to use the new test structure
